## Purpose of Incident Analysis:

Understanding and analysing incidents within an organization is crucial for proactive management. 
Incident analysis allows us to delve into the details of events, identify patterns, and derive valuable insights. By comprehensively examining incidents, aim is to enhance decision-making processes, improve response strategies, and ultimately contribute to a more resilient and efficient operational environment.

Goal of the Analysis:
To present key findings and insights derived from our incident analysis. Through visualizations and data-driven narratives, aim to convey actionable information that can guide strategic decisions, optimize incident response, and bolster overall organizational resilience. Our focus is on translating complex data into meaningful takeaways that empower stakeholders to make informed choices and improve our incident management processes.

## Dataset Brief:
Time Range Covered:
  - The dataset encompasses incidents reported within the Month range JUNE to AUGUST.
  
Types of Incidents Included:
  - The dataset captures a variety of incident types spanning different severity levels, services, assignment groups, products and departments.

Key Dataset Columns:
  - Number(Incidents), Month, Site, Opened, Assigned to, Assignment group, Owner group, Status, Opened by, Severity, Service, Contact type, Service Offering, Type, Category, Configuration item, Created, Resolved, Closed, Caller Department, Short description, Description, Translation, KB Article Used, Caller Notes, Region, Reassignment count, Product, Issues.

1.  Total Incidents:
   Definition: The total number of reported incidents during the specified time period. 
   Insight: This metric provides an overall view of incident frequency, helping us understand the volume of events that occurred.
2.  MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve):
Definition: The average time taken to resolve incidents from the moment they are reported.
Insight: MTTR indicates the efficiency of our incident resolution process. A lower MTTR suggests quicker issue resolution and improved service levels.
3.  MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures):
 Definition: The average time elapsed between consecutive incidents.
 Insight: MTBF helps assess the reliability of our systems or processes. A higher MTBF suggests a more stable operational environment.
4.  Reassignment Rate:
 Definition: The percentage of incidents that were reassigned to another team or individual.
 Insight: This metric reveals how often incidents are redirected to different teams, indicating potential challenges in initial assignment or communication gaps.
5.  Incidents with No Assignment:
 Definition: Incidents with no reassignment refer to cases where the initial assignee or assignment group successfully handles and resolves the incident without the need for it to be reassigned to another individual or team. 
 Insight: The absence of reassignments suggests that the incident was successfully addressed by the initial responder or team, minimizing the need for additional involvement.

## Detailed Analysis using Key insights from Power BI dashboard:

1. Increasing Incident Creation:
   - Insight: The total number of incidents has seen a significant rise, particularly in August (2877 incidents) compared to July and June, indicating a growing trend in reported issues.
For August, ‘failure’ incidents – 1680 , ‘request’ incidents – 1107.
   -  There are 4408 incidents out of total 8448 created due to ‘Failure’ in various categories which is a big chunk.
       3774 incidents out of 8448 created as ‘request’.
2. Low Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR):
   - Insight: The MTTR is impressively low at 1.78 days, suggesting efficient incident resolution.
For August, ‘failure’ incidents – 1680 having MTTR: 2.31.
                    ‘request’ incidents – 1107 having MTTR: 1.20.
3. High Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF):
   - Insight: The MTBF of 0.01 days indicates a relatively infrequent occurrence of incidents, highlighting a stable operational environment.
‘request incidents’ has little higher MTBF than ‘failure incidents’
4. Low Reassignment Rate:
   - Insight: A reassignment rate of 0.45 suggests incidents are typically assigned correctly on the first attempt, minimizing the need for redirection. 45% incidents are reassigned in August. Also ‘failure incidents’ are reassigned more times than ‘request incidents’.
5. Unresolved Incidents:
   - Insight: A substantial number of incidents (1942-581=1361) remain open, indicating a challenge in timely resolution. Those incidents for which the reported issue is considered closed without a full resolution. It includes cases where further action is unnecessary, such as when the reported issue was a duplicate, invalid, or no longer relevant.
 6. Top Five Issues:
   - Insight: Issues such as ACCESS ISSUE, PROACTIVE INCIDENT, CONNECTIVITY, LOGIN, INSTALLATION, INITIAL PASSWORD and DROP CA dominate, signifying the primary challenges faced.

## Recommendations & Conclusion:

1. Addressing Unresolved Incidents:
   - Recommendation: Conduct a thorough analysis of the unresolved incidents to identify root causes and implement corrective measures. Consider implementing additional training or resources   to address persistent challenges.
   - Actionable Steps: Initiate a team to investigate open incidents, categorize the reasons for delays, and implement targeted solutions.

2. Proactive Issue Resolution:
   - Recommendation: Given the low MTTR, continue the focus on proactive issue resolution to maintain efficient incident management.
   -  Actionable Steps:  Enhance communication channels, ensure prompt issue identification, and streamline resolution processes for continuous improvement.

3. Exploring Causes of Incident Increase:
   - Recommendation: Investigate the significant increase in incident creation, especially in August, to understand underlying factors and prevent future escalations.
   - Actionable Steps: Collaborate with relevant departments to identify patterns, conduct trend analysis, and implement preventive measures to mitigate a surge in incidents.

4. Enhancing Incident Response Strategy:
   - Recommendation: Despite a low reassignment rate, explore ways to optimize incident assignment processes for even greater efficiency.
   - Actionable Steps: Evaluate the current incident assignment workflow, seek feedback from assignees, and implement improvements to minimize reassignments.

SLA Consideration: Review and refine SLAs to ensure they align with the timeframes identified during the analysis. Communicate any necessary adjustments to stakeholders. Ensure that SLAs accurately reflect the optimized incident assignment process, and adjust as needed to align with enhanced efficiency..

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, the incident analysis dashboard has provided valuable insights into our operational landscape. While our incident management demonstrates efficiency in resolving issues promptly (low MTTR and high MTBF), there are areas for improvement, such as addressing unresolved incidents and exploring the causes of the recent surge in incidents. The identification of top issues, common severities, and key assignees further guides us in strategizing for proactive incident resolution. SLA considerations are essential for aligning recommendations with performance expectations and ensuring a commitment to service quality.
